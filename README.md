# shade_orb
Home Assistan Custom component to control Shade ORB lights.

Please don't install this component, it's not ready yet. It looks like the BLE commands are prefixed a 4 byte identifier, unique to each setup. I'm trying to figure out how to get this identifier. The only way I know is to sniff the BLE traffic on the phone. If you have any idea, please let me know.
